    <img src="../images/smash-burger.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="A double smashburger with cheese and pickles"/> 

    <h2>A timeless variation on the classic cheeseburger.</h2>

    <P>What seperates a <strong>smashburger</strong> from a standard hamburger are the beef patties, which 
        are pressed thin against the griddle or pan, resulting in thing and crispy edges and a caramelized flavor. 
    
    <ul><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper or Preferred Seasoning</li>
        <li>Chedder or American Cheese</li>
        <li>Hamburger Buns</li>
        <li>Preferred Condiments</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h3>Process:</h3>
        <li><strong>Form the Beef: </strong>Take a small handful of your preferred ground beef mixture and form it into a small ball. Repeat with all of your ground beef. </li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Griddle: </strong>Heat your griddle or pan to about 375 degrees fahrenheit.</li>

        <li><strong>Smash the Patties: </strong>Place a beef ball on the griddle, then drape a sheet of parchment paper over it. Now take a flat spatula or beef press and press down
            on the beef ball until thin. Roll the spatula to the edges to ensure a nice caramelized crisp. Now remove the parchement paper, season with salt and pepper, and
            cook on both sides. Once flipped, add a slice of your preferred cheese to the top side of the patty.</li>

        <li><strong>Toast the Buns: </strong>Apply a thin coat of butter the both inside halves of your hamburger buns. In a seperate pan or empty part of the griddle, add both buns,
            butter side down. Toast until golden brown.</li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the Burger: </strong>Put your preferred condiments on the bottom bun, then stack the patties on top, add pickles if desired, and then place the 
            other half of the bun on top.</li>
            
    </ol>
