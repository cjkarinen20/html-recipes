    <h2>An English breakfast favorite.</h2>
    
    <P><strong>Eggs Benedict</strong> is an easy and delicious breakfast you can make at home.
        It starts with a toasted english muffin, topped with a slice of Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and a generous dollop of hollandaise sauce.</P>
    
    <ul><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sliced Canadian Bacon</li>
        <li>English Muffins</li>
        <li>Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>White Vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h3>Process:</h3>

        <li><Strong>Poach the eggs: </Strong> Fill a pot with roughly 3 inches of water. 
            Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer. 
            Add a splash of vinegar to help the egg whites stay together. 
            Crack an egg into a measuring cup and slowly lower it into the pot. 
            Allow the egg to cook for 3-5 minutes, then remove it with a slotted spoon.</li>

        <li><strong>Make the hollandaise sauce: </strong> First, melt butter in a sauce pan. Next, beat the eggs yolks in a seperate bowl and add lime juice, 
            heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Now take the melted butter and add it to the egg mixture one spoonful at a time. Continuously stir the egg mixture as you
            add the butter. The goal is to evenly incorporate the butter, ensuring that the eggs temper. Too little movement will cause the eggs to curdle.</li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the egg muffins: </strong> Add 1-2 slices of Canadian bacon to one half of a toasted English muffin, then top with the poached egg.</li>

        <li><strong>Top with the hollandaise sauce: </strong> Top the assembled muffin with a generous helping of hollandaise sauce.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>

    </ol>
