        <li>Kombu</li>
        <li>Ramen Noodles</li>
        <li>Pork or Chicken Stock</li>
        <li>Shiitake Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Neutral Tasting Oil</li>
        <li>Toasted Seasame Seed Oil</li>
        <li>Fresh Ginger</li>
        <li>Miced Garlic</li>
        <li>Sake</li>
        <li>Dashi</li>
        <li>Chashu</li>
        <li>Soft-Boiled Eggs</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h3>Process:</h3>

        <li><strong>Prepare the tare: </strong>In a small saucepan, combine the Shoyu, Mirin, and Kombu. Heat over medium heat until steaming. 
            Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes, and discard the Kombu. Transfer into a seperate container and refrigerate.</li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the soup base: </strong>Place the dried mushrooms in a medium bowl. In a medium saucepan, heat the pork or chicken stock 
        over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a boil, pour the hot broth over the mushrooms and cover the bowl with foil. Let steep and rehydrate for 10 - 15 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Strain the mushrooms: </strong>Remove the mushrooms and squeeze them out over the water bowl, making sure to catch the excess liquid.
        Remove and discard the mushroom stems. Slice the mushroom tops into 1/4-inch slices.</li>

        <li><strong>Cook the broth: </strong>In a stock pot, heat your neutral-tasting oil and seasame oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the ginger and garlic.
            Saute until fragrant and then stir in the sake. Increase the heat to medium-high, and boil until the liquid has mostly evaporated. Next, stir 
            in your mushroom infused chicken or pork stock. Reduce heat to medium, and let simmer for 10 more minutes. Lastly, strain the broth through
            a fine mesh sieve, and discard the solids. </li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the ramen bowls: </strong>Into each serving bowl, spoon in a couple of teaspoons of the tare, then add your noodles on top. 
            Ladle in your broth, and add the sliced mushrooms. Lastly, add any other toppings of choice like chicken, pork, seaweed, soft-boiled eggs
            or chopped green onion.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy!</strong></li>

    </ol>
