    <ol><h3>Process:</h3>

        <li><strong>Make the tomato sauce: </strong> Start by sauteing chopped onions, bell peppers, and garlic with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a large (covered) skillet or pan. 
            Season with kosher salt and coriander, paprika, cumin, and crushed pepper flakes. 
            Cook for at least 5 minutes, stirring, until the veggies are tender, then add fresh diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce. 
            Bring the tomatoes to a boil, then cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes, then uncover and cook a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened.</li>

        <li><strong>Poach the eggs in the tomato sauce: </strong> Once the sauce has thickened, use the back of a spoon to make several holes in the sauce.</li>

        <li><strong>Get ready to serve: </strong> After the egg whites have settled, garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
